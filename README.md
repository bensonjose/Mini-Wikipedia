# Mini-Wikipedia
Hii, I developed a Mini Wikipedia<br>
Yeahh, As the name suggests it's just small version of Wikipedia.<br>
To be noted is that, it's not as efficient as i expect it to be, and i am trying to improve it.<br>
<br>

Working:<br>
You can enter an input(can be your area of interest) and it will get you the information*(will fetch you a summary relevant to the input provided).<br>
<br>

The 2 main modules that I've used in this project are:<br>
01.**pyttsx3**<br>
pyttsx3 is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline, and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.<br>
02.**wikipedia**<br>
Python provides the Wikipedia module (or API) to scrap the data from the Wikipedia pages. This module allows us to get and parse the information from Wikipedia.<br>



Voila!! Have a glimpse on my project.<br>
